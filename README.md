# Python Keylogger
This Python keylogger is a simple yet powerful tool for capturing keystrokes, system information, screenshots, and copied clipboard data on a target system. It runs in the background and logs all keyboard input and screenshots storing it in a hidden file for later retrieval.

## Features:

-Gets Computer Information (RAM, OS) & Network Information (IP Address, MAC Address)

-Stealth Mode: The keylogger operates silently in the background, without alerting the user.

-Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

-Customizable Logging: Log keystrokes to a text file with customizable formatting.
